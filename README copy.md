- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
